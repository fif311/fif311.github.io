## Introduction

<img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.bA3FrHZBjOYGmh9viW68CAHaHa?pid=Api" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" al>My name is Fiia. I am a student in the University of Helsinki studying language technology and society and change. I've studied in the department of languages
for two years already, but decided that I want so pursue societal studies instead. Nevertheless, I'm going to finish
my bachelor's program in the department of languages and do a bachelor's thesis on language technology. The topic of
my thesis isn't clear yet but I would like to do or review research on AI tools in digital advertising.
In my studies of society and change I'm so far mostly interested in studying political history, though economic history
seems interesting as well! On my free time I like to do creative things like drawing and painting, and I also really
enjoy cooking and making my own bread :)
