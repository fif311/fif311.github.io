## Week 1

Got familiar with the command line environment after setting it up. I didn't know I could use bash in the Windows command
prompt! Also learned a few commands for inspecting files, like head, tail and sort.


## Week 2

I had fun with the text processing exercises. Learned how to create a frequency list and find different words in a text
file. Also learned about sed and egrep which were super useful. Thankfully I'd learned about regular expressions
previously, because they're still somewhat confusing.


## Week 3

Learned about scripting, different kind of variables. The concept of environment variables seemed a bit confusing at
first but the reading material turned out to be very clearly written and helpful. I had some trouble with installing
python packages but eventually figured out what was causing errors in my system by vigorous googling.


## Week 4

Got introduced to ssh and Puhti. The more complicated thing was learning about version control, but I get why it's
very useful when keeping track of (bigger) projects and monitoring changes in a project.
